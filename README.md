## Analysis 
 The purpose of the assignment was to create a summary of the ridesharing data by city type, and then to create a multi-line graph that shows weekly fares for each city type.  
## Results 
The city type with the most amount of rides would be Urban. This would have been my hypothesis before the data was analyzed. Here is a comparison of the different cities total number of ride shares.
